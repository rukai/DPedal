## BOM

* RP pico 1 (headerless)
* micro USB cable (for standard pico)
* USB C cable (if using USB C pico)
* 3D printed parts
* 8 x M3 x 10m (9.5mm shaft)
* 8 x M3 square nuts
* 2 x choc buttons
* wire lengths (including stripped ends):
  * button left: 70mm
  * dpad left: 55mm
  * dpad top: 70mm
  * dpad right: 150mm (technically 145mm)
  * dpad bottom: 150mm
  * button right: 140mm

## tools

* soldering iron + solder
* hex key

## steps

1. cut wires and strip ends, strip about ~2-3mm
    * cut the longer wires first, in case you mess up the stripping and your long wires need to become short wires :)
2. solder wires to pico
3. place pico in pico base
4. place pico base and non-pico base next to each other
5. place switch plate on top of pico base, thread through all the soldered wires out of the switch holes
6. screw the switch plate on to the pico base
7. solder the wires to switches, one switch per socket
8. clip the switches into their sockets
9. Put the dpad between the two base pieces and push the pieces together.
10. Screw the right base to the switch plate
11. Push the 2 buttons into the 2 empty switches
